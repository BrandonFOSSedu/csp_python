point. EX: 1, -4, 3.14, 8.0"""
STRINGLIT = """String literals are enclosed in single ' or double quotes ". When
Python encounters an opening ' or ", all of the following characters up to the
closing ' or " are part of the string literal."""
LISTLIT = """List literals are enclosed in [ ] brackets. The list is composed
of a defined sequence of individual elements. Each element is accessed through
an index number from 0 to len(listlit) - 1. Different elements can be instances
of different types. EX:
    listlit = [1, False, "Hello", 3.14]
    listlit[0] == 1         # Index 0 points to the 1st element of listlit
    listlit[2] == "Hello"   # Index 2 points to the 3rd element"""
CONSTANT =  """Constant variables are meant to be set to a specific value and
then to never change throughout the execution of the program. DO NOT reassign a
constant. The names of constants are typically written in all UPPERCASE.
Constants act as placeholders for the same value in different parts of the
program. By changing a constant between program executions, the programmer can
alter the behavior of the program for different literal values."""
